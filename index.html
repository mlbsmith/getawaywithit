                        <h3> Loneliness</h3>
                        <p>Loneliness is a complex and usually unpleasant emotional response to isolation. Loneliness typically
                            includes anxious feelings about a lack of connection or communication with other beings, both
                            in the present and extending into the future.</p>

                        <p>Acute pain is a severe or sudden pain that resolves within a certain amount of time. You might feel
                            acute pain when you have an illness, injury or surgery. Chronic pain is persistent, lasting for
                            months or even longer.</p>

                        <h3> Anger</h3>
                        <p>Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism toward someone or something you feel has deliberately
                            done you wrong. Anger can be a good thing. It can give you a way to express negative feelings,
                            for example, or motivate you to find solutions to problems. But excessive anger can cause problems</p>
